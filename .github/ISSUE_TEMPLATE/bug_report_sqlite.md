## File a bug

Remember:

* Please check that the [documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/ef/) does not explain the behavior you are seeing.
 

### Include your code

To fix any bug we must first reproduce it. To make this possible, please attach a small, runnable project or post a small, runnable code listing that reproduces what you are seeing.

It is often impossible for us to reproduce a bug when working with only code snippets since we have to guess at the missing code.

Use triple-tick code fences for any posted code. For example:

```C#
Console.WriteLine("Hello, World!");
```

### Include stack traces

Include the full exception message and stack trace for any exception you encounter.

Use triple-tick fences for stack traces. For example:

```
Unhandled exception. System.NullReferenceException: Object reference not set to an instance of an object.

   at SixFour.Main() in C:\Stuff\AllTogetherNow\SixFour\SixFour.cs:line 54
